Provide a brief explanation of your approach

Explaination - 

Box Sizing and Reset:
I applied box-sizing: border-box globally to ensure padding and borders are included in the element's total width and height. The universal selector (*) with margin and padding set to 0 ensures a consistent starting point.

Font and Body Styles:
I set the font-family for the entire body to Arial, sans-serif to provide a clean and widely supported font.

Navigation Bar (Heading):
The navigation bar (.heading) uses flexbox for layout, allowing for easy centering of items. The links (a) are styled with margin and color. Adjustments have been made for better responsiveness, and the #about link now has a percentage-based padding for positioning.

Carousel Container and Slides:
The .carousel-container is set to max-width: 100% for responsiveness. The .mySlides images have been adjusted to be 80% wide, and padding has been added for better spacing. The display property is set to none initially, and the images are displayed one at a time using JavaScript.

Navigation Arrows:
Navigation arrows (.prev and .next) are styled with a background color and padding. The buttons have been updated to use the <button> element for better accessibility. The @media query adjusts the navigation bar for smaller screens, changing its direction to a column layout.

JavaScript for Carousel Functionality:
JavaScript functions (carousel, plusSlides, showSlides) control the automatic carousel rotation and manual navigation through the slides.

Responsive Design:
A media query (@media (max-width: 768px)) has been added to adjust the layout for screens with a maximum width of 768px, providing a more user-friendly experience on smaller devices.
